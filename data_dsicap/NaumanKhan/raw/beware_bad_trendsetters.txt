And when that is said, societal pressure, we usually think of bigger things but really it boils down to even those microscopic details in our life. Those of you that have children will notice your children want a certain toy & more than anything else sometimes they want that toy because someone else at school has it. They wanna get what somebody else has. That’s a formal societal pressure. Your children start getting a little bit older & they wanna dress a certain way & the idea of them wanting to dress that certain way didn’t come from their own imagination; it came from something they saw on TV that was defined to them as “THE WAY TO DRESS” or someone they saw dressed that way at school & is popular & that sort of becomes the defining thing for them & they wanna dress that way or look that way or buy that gadget or have a phone, little kids wanting to have a phone, right? “What you need a phone for?”, “I don’t know, my friends have it too, why can’t I have it?” You probably parents have heard that logic before, “they have it, why can’t I have it.” When you get a little bit older, the same societal pressure, it takes different forms. It can be something as simple as you parking your car at your office in the parking lot & your co-worker has a nicer car & you go “Man! I need to get ahead. Look at what these guys are driving.” You know, the neighborhood you live in, & you go visit one of your friend’s house who lives in a nicer neighborhood & the thought is running in your mind “Man! When am I gonna get to this point? I need to be where this guy is at or better.” We are always comparing ourselves to what other people have & we are constantly vying consciously or subconsciously to get what the other people have also. This is what I mean by societal pressure. Whether it comes in the form of you dressing, or it comes in the form of what you purchase, where you put your money, what kind of career you want to pursue. A lot of times our parents, they are giving this societal pressure, so whether their children are made for that or not, they will make sure they say to their children “You better become a medical doctor, because if you don’t, you are a failure in life.” Everybody else that are around as that are successful they are all doctors, so that’s the only thing in life to do. And I am not saying being a physician is a bad practice, but if your son or daughter becomes a doctor & they didn’t want to be, I would never wanna be their patient. I wouldn’t wanna go to them if the only reason they chose this profession is because their parents forced them to or because of some kind of societal pressure. These are pressures that exist all around us, this comparison stuff, it’s all around us. And it can become so strong, that a person can almost feel enslaved. They are not even free anymore, which is really ironic that we are living in a society that prides itself over being free, right? It prides itself over independent freedom, “I can do whatever I want, dress however I want, talk however I want, look however I want, spend my money on whatever I want.” That’s the thing that makes a society take pride in itself & yet if you go somewhere as simple as high school, you’ll find a bunch of kids that are dressed almost exactly the same. They are just exactly the same. All the hip hop kids, they look the same, all the Goth kids look the same, all the emo kids look the same. It’s almost like they go through a uniform & even the way they talk, has to be a certain way to fit in with that crowd. And if you don’t fit in with that crowd, then you are an outcast. And so when you look at that, I don’t see freedom when I see that. What I see is cultural slavery. This young man or this young woman can’t even make that decision of how to look or how to talk or how to walk for themselves. They have to conform to what is going on around them. And sometimes it’s willing; sometimes you submit that, that is the better way to live, that is the better way to dress or to talk or that is the better thing to do with my time, that’s the kind of music I wanna be addicted to or these are the kinds of practices I’ll do. Whatever, that’s one conscious decision a person makes that that’s the life to live & sometimes it’s even pressured. I have met Muslim teenage kids that have come to me in private & when you look at them you are like “Man, this guy is in a gang or something?” & they’ll come to you in private & they will be crying because they say “I don’t wanna be dressed like this, I don’t wanna look like this, but if I don’t I’ll get beat up at school.” That’s cultural slavery. That’s a form of slavery. But it’s not just about the youth & whether they become slave to musical culture or entertainment culture & they wanna be just like whatever you know that famous athlete or musician or actor is, it’s beyond that, it’s even for older generations. For our older generations, this kind of cultural slavery takes a different texture. It takes a different tone. You did the things a certain way in your country or in your society, you saw that your entire life. You wanna make sure that your family & your children will do things exactly the same way, whether it’s god for them or not, it doesn’t matter, “This is how we do things, this is how it has to be done.” & we are enslaved to certain definitions. In that context, what I wanna share with you first & foremost is a very powerful ayah about the role of the Prophet (SAW), one of the functions of the messenger of Allah ‘Alayhi Assalatu Wassalam that is described in Surah Al A’araaf, even though my khutbah today is not about this ayah. My khutbah today is about a couple of ayahs from Surah Al Baqarah, but I wanna start from this ayah from Surah Al A’araaf. Allah ‘Azzawajal is talking to people of the book, who know that the prophet has been told about in their own books. So this final messenger (SAW) is foretold in their own books & Allah is testifying to that in this ayah. That part of the ayah I’ll skip through, but I’ll tell you the part of the ayah that describes the messenger’s role (SAW). He says: “???????????? ?????????????? ????????????? ???? ?????????? ????????? ?????? ????????????? ??????????? ?????????? ????????????..” He commands them to good things; he forbids them from evil things. He opens the doors for them, he makes permissible for them good & pure things & he makes impermissible for them filthy things. This is one of the central roles of the messenger of Allah & this final messenger of Allah that he will tell us to do good things, keep us away from bad things, open the door to pure things for us & close the door from filthy things away from us, so we stay away from the filthy things. But then Allah mentions something very powerful, “???????? ???????? ?????????? ???????????? ??????? ??????? ?????????..”, & to remove from them, listen to this part carefully, to remove from them the burdens, “????” is a heavy burden, it also actually means an agreement, so combining the two meanings does actually means a very heavy agreement, a loaded agreement, he came to remove that burden from them & “?????????”, “?????????? ???????? ???????? ?? ?????? " , chains that are put in the hands or around the neck, you know what kind of person has those kind of chains, you know right?, a prisoner. A prisoner has chains around his hands & chains around his neck. Allah says this messenger came to remove people of burdens & the chains that were around there hands & necks that they were enslaved by; he came to remove them. What chains are these? As society goes forward, the only thing even in a Muslim society of course the first thing we are concerned about like the first generation, the only thing on their minds was what is permissible, what is not permissible, what is it that we have to do & what is it that we have to forbid, that was their primary concern. Nothing else mattered, everything else was secondary. But as time goes in an ummah, society & its pressures starts mixing in, so you don’t just have the obligation to abide by what Allah says, now you also have the obligation to abide by what society says. You have got additional chains, you have got additional burdens & the messenger comes to let go of those burdens. We think we follow societal pressure because it will make life easy. It makes nothing but make life harder. A lot of times when people follow a particular tradition & I’ll give you an example closer to home, I am from Pakistan originally & this is a problem in Pakistan I’ll tell you. We have to have the most lavish kinds of weddings, the most exotic, the most over the top, super expensive kinds of weddings; even if the family can’t afford it. Even if they can’t afford it, they have to have that kind of wedding. And if you ask the family why are you doing this, why are you putting yourself in thousands of dollars of credit card debt, why are you doing that?, they say well your cousin had the wedding like that, what are we gonna show or how are we gonna show our face to your uncle or this friend of yours got married, they had a big wedding, how are we gonna just have a nikah at the masjid, what you are crazy?  We have to show our face in society. It’s not because the deen says you should go over the top, it’s what? Society. And so they’ll put themselves in all kinds of financial trouble & imagine a young man & woman who are just getting married & it will be lucky if they are young because if they are from the countries that we come from, they’ll not let them get married until they are like 30 or something, but if they are young & they get married, they are just starting out & they start there life with debt. They start there married life with this huge burden on them because this insane party that no one remembers three days later, for nothing else, just to fulfill the societal urge, this pressure that somebody felt. No other reason. What are people gonna say,in urdu they say “log kya kahaingay”, right? What are people gonna say if we don’t do this. So much concern about what people might say & it leads you into your deeper troubles for yourself, on the other hand Allah says : “ "?????? ????? ???? ????????? ????????, Allah just wants to lighten your burden. Allah wants to take the load off of you; that’s what the deen is supposed to be & you’ll find people that are enslaved to their culture, they are enslaved to their societal pressure; when they talk about Islam, they say Islam is tough, Islam is too strict, that’s exactly what these people say; the Islam is too strict & what’s funny is, if they followed even small principles of the deen, their lives would be a lot easier. The deen would make their life easier, not harder. And what they are trying to follow, only lands them deeper, & deeper & deeper trouble. That’s what it lands them into. But they don’t realize it. A messenger comes to remove these burdens. But there is another meaning of these burdens also & these chains. You know when we follow a certain way in our life, our children learn from us just like our parents learnt from their parents & its past down. So when we stand in front of Allah on judgment day & we have generations of people who disobeyed Allah because of societal pressure, we are chained to them, we are tied to them; there burden is our burden because we set that trend, we set that precedent for them. We have to answer for what they have done also. They have to answer for themselves, & we on top of that. SubhanAllah! It’s a serious problem. This is why Ibraheem (AS) as an intelligent father makes the du’aa or actually we are taught to make the du’aa “?????????? ????????????? ?????? " , right?, make us Imam over Al Muttaqeen in Surat Ul Furqan. Because on judgment day we don’t wanna be tied to people that went down the wrong path. They are gonna drag us down with them. Now I wanna take you to the ayaat that this khutbah is actually about. This is from surat ul Baqarah; & in surat ul Baqarah towards the second half of this surah, one of the main conversations is what people follow, who they end up following & why they follow who they follow. Now this particular passage that I chose has to do with the Day of Judgment. And on judgment day everybody stands up & I want you to think of this way, there are trend setters & there are trend followers. You followed someone when you did something, you dressed a certain way, you walked a certain walk, you talked a certain talk, you bought a certain kind of car, you moved to a certain kind of neighborhood, you hung out with a certain kind of posy; these were your trend setters, you were around them. Most of what you did was influenced by them. These are your trend setters. This ayah is about them; these trend setters. These are the people that people like to follow.???? ??????? ????????? ?????? ???? ????????? ????????"”, When those who used to be followed, these are trend setters; when they will be cutting themselves off, disassociating themselves from all those who use to follow them. So here you are, you made your life miserable trying to be like someone, trying to fit in with a certain crowd, worried about what they are going to think of you, how acceptable you’ll be to them, judgment day comes around & the first thing these trend setters do, these leaders do, is to say I have nothing to do with you, why you tried to be like me, I want nothing to do with you, “ ??????? ????????? ?????? ???? ????????? ????????”, I got nothing to do with you & you’ll be like “Wait! You were the one who told me don’t rent an apartment, go get into a house, you were the one who said you have to be smart, go get into a mortgage; don’t worry about halal haram just do it & I listened to you & everybody around you, you guys were the ones who got me into this, you are the one who told me this is a good business idea, yea yea it’s got liquor too but it’s ok, don’t worry about it, Ramadan’s around the corner, you can make extra salawat you’ll be alright, it will clean it all up, don’t worry about it, it’s a good business I am telling you, a lot of money in it & I went into this business because I listened to you, I got into it because of you.” You know, you have certain circles in the Muslim community, I won’t even talk about outside Muslim community, that’s inside Muslim community; you have certain circles, you have the business circle, you have the professional circles, you have the physician circles & in each circle there are certain standards, right? There are certain kinds of parties they like to throw or there are certain kinds of gatherings they like to have & each one tries to outdo the other to keep up with the circle. They make each other, they feed each other in their wrongdoing & now they are cutting off from on each other on the judgment day. I want nothing to do with you, all that stuff that you did is your problem, not my problem. “???? ????????? ????????? ?? ???????????? ?????????? ??????????? ????????????????? ”, they will all be, Allah makes the jam’aa which combines everybody; the followers & the leaders are all looking at the punishment. “????????????? ?????? ??????????? “ , and all relationships at that point are cut. You don’t care about, no society or nobody else thinks then, it’s all gone, all zero. All of that stuff that we were so worried about here, completely erased. And now the people who mindlessly followed & before I talk about mindlessly following, I have to interject. On our flight here, from Dallas, I flew with my family to California maybe about ten days ago. All the kids were asleep, so my wife & I were the only ones awake & you know how they drop the TV screen, so thankfully the children were all asleep. So we were the only ones, even if you don’t want to its right in your face, the TV screen, right? And we don’t have headphones so it’s a silent film for us. You know what it was? It was the Justin Bieber documentary. So we watched the Justin Bieber documentary, it was torture. It’s like hour & a half, Justin Bieber in your face. But wallahi it was an educational experience. Every two minutes I just looked at my wife & go….Because you see him walk by & these girls are crying & they are screaming & their parents are so happy that he got to touch their daughters. This is how enslaved these people get. This is how crazy they get. This is ridiculous. You know, girls’ wearing his face on their book bags, on their shirts & it was mind boggling to me; how that can be?! And what’s that gonna look like on judgment day. “I got nothing to do with my fans; I want nothing to do with you.” “????????????? ?????? ??????????? “, & at that point all of the followers, what are they gonna say? “??????? ????????? ??????????? “, & those who used to follow, they are gonna be saying “????? ?????????????????? ????????? ????? ??????? ????????????? ????????", if we only had another chance we would cut ourselves off from them like they are cutting themselves off from us now. They are saying this on judgment day & they are crying, they are saying if we only had a chance, do they a get a chance? No. Do you & I have a chance? Yes. That’s why the ayah is telling us this. Don’t wait till the point where you regret it, be that now. And for a moment I wanna talk to the parents here; when we bought our children Disney gear & we buy our children, you know, we won’t let them watch whatever they wanna watch on TV or its just cartoons. It ain’t just cartoons anymore; let me tell you, it ain’t just cartoons anymore. They put a lot of stuff in there, right? And I used to teach in an Islamic school back in the day & you know these little girls would have like, you know, Hannah Montana book bags, coming to Islamic school, right? They have got these girls book bags & they are fans of them & they watch all the shows & stuff. And when these same girls are at on Disney or whatever nickelodeon or whatever, when they are teenagers, when they are twenty, when they are nineteen, they are half naked & now what you gonna do? How you gonna explain that to your children? You allowed them to be trend followers; you did that, I did that. We have to be cautious. What are we allowing our children to become? Before you know it, they’ll be out of your control. They’ll be enslaved to that culture. Some of you are experiencing that now. Some of your children are teenagers & you don’t even recognize them, like “what happened to you? Why are you dressed liked that? What are you doing with your hair, what is that?” You won’t know but it’s a trend & they are just following. That’s all they are doing.  “??????? ??????????? ?????????? ???? ????? ????? ??????? ????????????? ???????? ????? ???????????? ?????? ??????? ?????????? ????? ???????????? ????????? ????????? ????? ???? ???????????? ???? ???????? “That is how Allah shows them all of their deeds so they cannot just “???????? ?????????  “, it’s unique, Allah says “????????? ????????? “ , regret on top of regret on top of regret following over them. Punishment itself is bad, but regret is a form of punishment itself. When you regret something, when the regret really overtakes you, it’s a kind of a torture itself. Allah says it will be coming on them over and over & over again. “Why didn’t I listen, why didn’t I change myself?!, How did I allow myself to be like this?”, & they won’t be coming out of the fire; “????? ???? ???????????? ???? ???????? “.“????? ???????????? “  Right after this ayah, Allah ‘Azzawajal gives us a commandment about consuming halal. “??? ???????? ???????? ?????? ?????? ??? ????????? ???????? ???????? ????? ??????????? ????????? ???????????? ? ??????? ?????? ??????? ??????? “It’s really interesting, because most of the time when we follow trends, what do we leave? We leave the halal. We leave the permissible & we pursue the impermissible. So Allah reminds us; look, don’t fall into those trends, don’t fall into that pressure; consume that which is halal, what is good & pure. Don’t follow the footsteps of shaytan. And here we are thinking we are following the footsteps of society & Allah is telling us No, No, No that was just a shallow cover, the reality of it was, these were footsteps of shaytan. “??????? ?????? ??????? ??????? “& then the last thing; what does shaytan do? What are the two things that he will get you to commit? “???????? ???????????? ?????????? ????????????? ????? ?????????? ????? ?????? ??? ??? ?????????? “ , he’ll command you to evil, he’ll command you to shamelessness & to say things about Allah you have no idea of. I wanna explain that briefly & this khutbah is done. When people want to follow whatever they want it is they want to follow & they don’t wanna hear about the deen, “Islam is too strict”, “I don’t know, I go to Jumu’ah & stuff but that’s already more than enough.” I am doing a lot of favor by being on Jumu’ah, you know, showing up. I don’t even just be there on time, if I just show up before they start praying or before they say salam, that’s enough for me. Last in, first out, right? That’s the majority of the congregation usually. If you are that person, then listen to this & just listen for a moment. If you think you are doing Allah’s deen a favor, & what you really need to live your life for has already been defined for you by your culture, by your tribe, by outsiders, by what everybody else follows, then you are not free at all. You are not free at all. You are a slave. The only ones that are truly free are Allah’s slaves. They don’t feel the need to be like everybody else. They don’t feel the need to spend their money in places that are useless, that are a waste. They see above that, they are mature. And so in this note, I just wanna give you an example of our daughters because this is an important subject; something I have been talking about recently & I feel it’s critical along these lines. Trend setting & what affects it’s happening on Muslim girls, on our daughters. There is a crisis in the Muslim community when it comes to our daughters; a crisis of self-esteem. A crisis of self- esteem. We are already a different culture before 9/11; we are already a very different tradition than regular western society. We are very different in many ways, especially in the way we dress, especially in the commitment we have to modesty. After 9/11 it’s been ten years now & the hatred & the animosity & the spiteful language that spews out of people’s mouths about Islam has increased ten folds, it’s not a hundred fold. So it was already difficult to follow & now it’s become something everybody hates & in the middle of all of that is our daughters. They go to public school. Even if they go to Islamic school, doesn’t even matter. Then they go to college & they are covering themselves & they see girls dressed however they are dressed & a thought runs in the mind of a young Muslim girl “Why can’t I dress like that?”, “Man! Anything fun is haram, she looks so pretty, why can’t I look pretty, why can’t I be like that?” That thought crosses her mind. She’s afraid to say it but it crosses her mind & she’s always thinking & she’s depressed. “I look ugly because of this thing, people make fun of me.” You know, “Why are we such a backward society, I don’t even know why I have to wear it.” That’s a serious problem. That’s trend setting inside, even if it’s not outside; inside it’s a bigger problem. The heart is now submitted to what is rebellion to Allah. This only happens when we don’t give our sons & especially our daughters, enough self-esteem. Where does self-esteem come from, this is the last thing I’ll share with you. Because this problem of following trends in society is a big one, but probably the biggest component of that, is saving our children; saving our children from becoming swept away with the flood. So this is the last bit I wanna share with you. And that is we have to acknowledge, fathers especially, have to spend time with their daughters. Fathers have to encourage their daughters. Fathers have to appreciate their daughters. Fathers have to tell their daughters they look beautiful, so they don’t have to look for that from some idiot on Facebook; they don’t have to do that, because their fathers are telling them that. They get that, you know the kind of self- confidence the girl gets from her dad is irreplaceable. Not even the mother, mother’s critical but not when it comes to this, when it comes to the acknowledgement of the father. When have you last time you talked to your daughter, those of you that have daughters? Actually had a conversation with her? You know, our daughters, I brought two of my four daughters with me on this trip; girls talk a lot, they talk a lot, they never run out of things to say, which is why for men a lot of times, the moment you hear them, OK, OK, OK.. Yea, Yea, Yea that’s nice, that’s nice & you don’t really listen, right? Listen to your daughters, talk to them, because if you are ignoring them now, when they get older they’ll be ignoring you. They’ll be ignoring you. It doesn’t matter if they are talking about hair clips or what their friends said at school or what coloring projects they were doing or where they visited or what show they.. Whatever, talk to them, communicate with them. They need that from you. You need to play that role as a father. We cannot allow our children to fall into that, you know, get swept away into that culture; we can’t. So this is one, you know, last bit of advice that I really really wanted to share with you. Because if we don’t do that wallahi I am telling you, if we don’t do that, we are cheating our daughters from a proper raising. We are cheating even our sons & since I talked about daughters so much, I’ll say just one thing about sons; play with your sons. Spend time with your sons. Play sports with them. Most of our dads are so out of shape, they come home they pick up their child for two minutes & they are like hhaaaa (out of breath) & then they just passed out on the couch. Get in shape for your kids. Not for yourself, for your kids. Play with them. You need to be better friend to them than anyone else. Because wallahi this society offers lots of evil friends. It does. And before they make those kinds of friends, they need to find their best friend in you. It’s not the way we did things back home; back home, you weren’t friends with your dad. Your dad came home & you sat straight. Your dad spoke & you stood up & responded. There was a relationship of respect; distant relationship. You don’t chill with your dad, right? You don’t do that. Here you have to do that; you have to do that. Not just you should, you have to. We have to become those people. Because if we don’t, again this flood will come & just take our kids away. It will just come & take them away. I pray that we are not of the people who are followers of evil trends. I pray we are the kinds of people & you know, when Allah talks about these trend followers, He did mention that here’s a trend you should follow. “ ???????????? ??????? ???????????? ???????? “, Follow the way of Ibraheem & you know what that way of Ibraheem is, right?,  didn’t follow anybody else. Everybody is worshipping idols, I am gonna break them. Everybody is going this way, he’s gonna go that way. He’s gonna go the way that Allah wants them to go. That’s the trend to follow. That’s the people we become. May Allah make us from the millah of Ibraheem (AS). May Allah make us understand His book the way it should be understood. May Allah protect our children from falling into the tide of cultural forces & pressures. May Allah make us of those who understand His book, love His book & implement His book in our lives. May Allah open the doors of its wisdom & the wisdom of the Sunnah of His messenger (SAW) to all of us. ???? ???? ?? ???? ?? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ??????"”
