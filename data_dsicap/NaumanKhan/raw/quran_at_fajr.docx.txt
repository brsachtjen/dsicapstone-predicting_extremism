  Quran at fajr by Naumaan Ali Khan –Quran Weekly                (After Raciting dua before speech)A couple of minute I wanna share with you a smaller section from  one of the very beautiful passage of surah al Israa, surah al Israa being surah no 17 of the Quran, in which Allah talks about  the value of the Quran itself and really the institution that helps us to experience the Quran.          You know the one thing is to learn language of the Quran and another study its tafseer , its recitation , and memorize it , But Quran is really experienced in Salaat itself . So Allah says -Establish the salaah “ akeme us salata “ “ ledulukish shamse el’a gasekel lail” actually means from the time the sun start getting loose and it start sinking , meaning aroung magrib time you know you make sure , you make the magrib exactly on the time . “el’a gasakel lail” all the way at the end , towards you know when the sun completely gone and its depth of Night.               “ Wa Quran al fajr “ He (Allah) dint call salaat al fajr like establish the prayer in magrib , establish the prayer esha when its really  dark at night. But when He (Allah) come at fajr , He dint call even salaatul Fajr , He says “wa Quran al fajr” the Quran of fajr . One of the benefit is that of course we should recite extra Quran at fajr , but there is something special about me as person , me as Muslim developing relation with the Quran specially at fajr , so the advice I give myself and this advice I am sharing with all of  you . As if you can make fajr institution in your life, set time aside for making good for fajr salaah , young men that  listening to this! go make to salaah at masjid , and the days when you do you sit there and you recite Quran a little bit , if u can dedicate that time and make that time in your life then you will notice the spiritual benefits and the worldly benefits of doing that immediately . “ Inna Quran al fajre kaa’na mash hooda’a”Allah says that Quran at fajr in same ayah , No doubt about it , it is witness. This is such beautiful things to say because the word “mashood” means that which is witness. To the fajr of Quran , to the recitation of the Quran , the prayer that you recited , you attended is witness.            The Question is witness by who ? you know that! this hours of day most of the people sleep , so even somebody is walking for prayer , driving for prayer, Nobody sees them. But Allah says that’s the time mashood , Usually the things that are mashood , the things that are witness are in middle of the day!  popular time , popular places ! but  masjid is not the popular place at fajr time , Not for most of us , salaat of fajr is not popular time for most of us ,It is not the time a lot of people around you  . But Allah says it  is   witness , but the question witness by who? Not by other people who are sleeping! Not by the people who are in gafalah   the people of heedlessness , the people of sleep ?but rather by the Angels that are recording our deeds , rather by the Allah himself who making note of this slave that are coming and leaving sleep of himself and his world . So this is very powerful thing , so try to do this advice! for myself and all of you , we can make a really good habit of going to sleep early . it  is easy to say and so hard to do , I know! I know! We have always the things to do , and we starts getting around in the evening , and of course shaitaan gets a extra activity in the evening too , so our distraction comes and you know you are sitting and watching videos ! hopefully not this one too in the morning . you are doing late late night and your fajr basically you know! Its kind of getting out of the way ,you have sleep , you pray a couple of rakah even you don’t know what you have prayed ! you know  your wadoo  was when u have sleep! In your prayer you have sleep  ! and  you go about your day .            If you wake up , if you are among those who wake up. We can make a real habit in our life of going to sleep early as result waking up early and really having “Quran of fajr” being given title Quran of fajr ! it is the one of the few  idafah , I don’t know any idafah  in the Quran except Quranahu its recital , that Quran is associated with something else directly like this would kind of construction except for fajr . So I pray I may take advantage of that and all of you are . I can give guarantee I know I experience it personally in my life and I can guarantee that you will experience yourselves. Once you make a habit all of this and you try to implemented even a little bit , you will start seeing its benefits immediately ! you know its not almost  immediately  you are gonna start seeing your mood is different , your days is  different , what you can accomplish is different  , the barakah your time is different .                 So I pray Allah ! Allah make us a people of Quran and the people who are really able to take advantage of times that Allah offers his special assistance to us  , his special lessons to us .                 Assalam u alaikum
