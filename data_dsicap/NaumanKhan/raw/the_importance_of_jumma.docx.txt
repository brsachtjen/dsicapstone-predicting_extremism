NAK LectureThe Importance of Jumma!Assalamualaikum!In sha Allahu ta’ala in today’s brief khutba I would like to share with you some reflections from Suratul Jum’a.I chose this Sura on purpose because a lot of times actually most of the times Muslims we come to jum’a over and over again and very few times we get an opportunity to talk about what makes jum’a itself and the prayer, itself, important.And even when we have a conversation about why it is important most of the time we have the conversation in terms of how to make the most of your Friday in terms of the practices of the Messenger Sallellahu Alaihe wa sallam of the morning, the night before, what part of the Quran to recite, how we should try and get to the prayer earlier, all of those other kinds of etiquette of the prayer itself.And that is important but that’s not what I want to share with you today.What I want to share with you today-is the spirit, the wisdom.And really the fundamental strategy of Allah aza auzal in pulling this program inside the Muslim community and making it a permanent feature of the Muslim community.I want to start with a very simple observation.You know, Muslims all over the world, they have halaqa, they have study circles, they have conferences and programs just like what we do here in the United States.And when we do, we have to advertise those programs.We have to make announcements, tell people to come, there is gonna be a program in the evening, there’s gonna be a program on the weekend.Now a days we have to put the facebook page up and twitter and mass e-mail.May be make YouTube videos to get the word out etc.etcWhatever means we can we advertise programs, even if they are religious in nature, we advertise them.Here’s one program every single week on Friday afternoon that you don’t get any e-mail or you don’t get any text message, you don’t have to mark it in your calendar.It doesn’t matter how religious you are or you are not religious at all.May be there are some of you in the audience, you don’t know this place, this masjid or any masjid for that matter except for Friday afternoon. That’s the only time you see this place.But you don’t have to be told.You just come on your own.And that’s something incredible.That the Muslim Ummah all together, it gathers on this day without invitation.Without even reminder.We have been programmed, Subhan Allah, the very knowledgeable of us and not the very knowledgeable of us , the extremely committed and practicing of us and those who are far from deen also a good majority of them as well show up on this day.And you will notice a bigger community gathers and some of them even lost their way even on jumma, you will see them on their Eid prayer, right?You will those people that you don’t see any other time of the year.But regardless I wanna focu on Friday. There is something Allah put inside this day.And this gathering in specific.That’s very important.And you know the Arab spring is not too old now, and it’s something that is still taking place and you guys are hearing in the news all the time.You know one of the scariest times for regimes, was right after jum’a as salah!Because they knew automatically people are gonna be gathered in all the Masajid any way so as they are leaving they are gonna give more momentum to the protest and more people will be out on the streets.So the things that will terrify the regimes, was salatul jum’a!Think about that.Because they knew this is time when the Muslims will show their strength, their numbers, you know!But what is the spirit of this particular day?And this activity itself that gives its power, this communal activity that all of us have the blessing to enjoy week after week after week.You know in this sura, this BTW this is suratul Jum’a.I chose it on purpose.Suratul Jum’a is the best place to learn the spirit, the wisdom, guidance about the Friday prayer itself.You know there’s one Aya that summarizes the mission of Allah’s Messenger Sallellahu Alaihewa sallam, just one Aya.You can study years.For years you can study the life of Allah’s Messenger Alaihi saltu wa sallam.People who do their entire PhDs like the Meccan period or like the Hijra.One aspect of the sirat, they can dedicate and study in-depth and write books and books and books on one particular portion of the sirat.But in this one Aya that belongs to the heart of the sura, it’s the second Aya of the sura, Allah Aza auzal basically takes the entire mission of the Messenger and summarizes it.And the summary of this Aya is what I share with you is basically the Messenger’s job was to bring about by Allah’s permission alaihe wa salatu wa salam, his job was to bring about a change in people’s lives.You know when we talk about the great changes of the world,we think of big empires what they left behind, buildings!I just recently had a chance to go to Europe and when I was in France one of my relatives was showing me around in Paris and they showed me the tomb of Napoleon and these large military academies that they have all over Europe.These historical cite these great empires of the world, if you go to Algeria, you will see the ruins of the Roman empire.You know, if you go to Egypt you will see the ruins of the Pharaohs from back in the day. This is what these great civilizations left behind, right?These cities, or these ancient buildings and artefacts and only thing we have left of those civilizations may be sitting in a Museum or it’s a broken down building where tourist go and take pictures.That’s all that’s left of them.What did our Messenger Alaihi Salatu wa Salam leave behind?We have to ask ourselves.One has to think.Part of buildings left behind.Mashjib Nabiyu was built on what at the time?It was covered in leaves.There’s no monumental structures, great highways that you can point to and people can go and point to and say, “Wow! Look at that, subhanAllah!”The thing that the Messenger Alaihe saltu wa salam left behind, by a large provision, is incredible human beings.Human beings that reminds us! Human beings that we point to and say, “This is the product of a great teacher.” These are the Sahabas Radiallahu ta’ala ajmain and who they left behind are the Kaberin and who the Qaberin left behind are generation after that.We are the product of Allah’s Messenger’s work Salellahu salatu wa salam.23 years of labour, 23 years of labour of this man by Allah’s permission and today a huge percentage of the population of the world says, “La ilaha Illellah”.Something happened in these 23 years.And it has been summarised in the most beautiful way in this Ayah of Suratul Jum’a.Allah Azauzal says….”I see them more incredible.”Before He even tells us what He does He tells us something about the Messenger and his humble beginnings.He says, “He, Allah is the One who appointed among the unlettered…Ummin”Al-Ummi, the Arabic word is usually translated as unlettered.What it really means that someone as unaware of outside education as you and I we came out of our mother.You haven’t been exposed to the outside world. All of you, your only education is from your mother.This is ummin.This is the messenger of Allah says in this group of people that did not have libraries and universities.They did not have huge learning institutions and huge history of literature or philosophy.They didn’t have any of that.This is among whom the Messenger was sent alaihi salatu wa sallam.Now a days when you think of a person of influence a person who is gonna teach me something, you think of his credential, where did he graduate from, what’s his degree?What are his qualifications?Allah tells you his qualifications before He even tells you what he does, Alaihi slatu wa salam.He is sent among the Ummin.Rasulam minhum …a Messenger from among themselves.It’s not that he was above them, he was just chosen among them.He was among them.In another place in the Quran Allah says, “Your companion, the one who spent the entire life with you.”The Messenger himself. He is not an outsider.“He is from among you.”And on the side note I should tell you one of the things the disbelievers could not understand about the Messenger alaihi salatu wa sallam, “They will find it very strange that a warner came to them from among themselves.”You know, what’s weird to them because warnings come from the outside.Back in the day, there used to be someone who used to go outside the village and sees an army coming and return back to the village and says, “Hey! There is a danger coming from the outside.”You have to be from the outside to give a warning.The Messenger is from among them and he rises and he started giving them warning from the danger coming.How can that be?You didn’t go anywhere!How can you get this information?So, they themselves found it strange that he is from among them.Regardless, Allah tells us about this beginning.Put it to this historical face.This is a dessert.The Roman empire, the Persian Empire, the Abyssinian empire, these big kingdoms of the time, these huge governments of the time, with massive, massive armies are all around, but nobody even bothers to take over Arabia.Not because they were scared of Arabia but because there were no oil yet.Right?There was nothing there.There was nothing there to take over.What’s the point?Why should you send the soldiers to go barbeque in the middle of the sand?What are they gonna get out of there?So everybody left the Arabs alone for thousands of years. They thought of it as useless territory.You know what big governments do right?To this day, when you have a big empire, all you are thinking about is expanding your empire.All you are thinking about is, “How do we take the borders further?”You have to wonder, why are these Arabs left alone for thousands of years.They didn’t see any value in this place.And if they don’t see a value in the place they will definitely not see a value in these people.Then what?And in this place that was considered just completely off the map for the big powers of the world Allah sends His final Messenger Sallelahu Alaihe wa sallam.And makes it the capital of the globe.When Ibrahim Alahihe wa sallam, when he went there to settle his family thousands of years ago and before them the first description we get of Mecca is…. “A valley that has no produce”It’s useless!It doesn’t even grow any plants. It’s that kind of land and that Allah made the capital of the globe for guidance.Subhan Allah.So, what does he do this Messenger in these 23 years? What’s his job?How does he bring about this amazing change that in only 23 years it is changing the globe?And come to think of people’s impactful event in history happens within two decades with the mission of this Messenger sallellahu alaihe wa sallam.How does that happen?He says, “We overlooked this so easily.”He says, he narrates on to them.He reads on to the people Allah’s Ayat.What we understand as the Quran.The Messenger‘s job, his first job Alaihi salatu wa salam, is to read on to the unlettered people of the Quran.I argue with you today that most of us are unlettered.Most of the Muslims are unlettered.We don’t konw Quran.We may be knowledgeable in accounting, some of you are knowledgeable in your business, all of us are knowledgeable in taxes, you know, there are people knowledgeable in areas of medicine and in history etc. etc.When it comes to knowledge of Allah’s book, we are unaware!Things here and there we know but for the most part we don’t know.We don’t know.The Messenger’s job is to introduce to people the incredible Ayat of Allah.And you know there’s no accident, this is mentioned in suratul Jumma.Because to this day, to this day, the function of Jumma is to get people familiarize with the Quran.The job of the Khatib, he should recite on to the people the Ayat of Allah.Remind people of Allah through His word, through His book.Because I can try and prepare a speech but if my speech is not centred around the word of Allah it won’t have the benefit that it otherwise have.Something among this Quran brought in this amazing change in people.And you and I believe that the Quran is the perfect word of Allah and we also have to believe that it still has the same power.So if it is shared with the people it will bring about the change in people.It will bring about a change in people.So Allah aza awzal says, “He purifies them.”The Messenger of Allah recites the Ayat on to people and by means of doing that a purification is happening.Of course the Messenger alaihi salatu wa salam is not just doing it every Friday, he is doing that all the time.But the convention every week, the big gathering of every week is jum’a is installation to Allah so that we get refreshed with our relationship with Quran .That’s what supposed to happen.Every single Friday!Now let’s talk a little bit about this purification.Because you know there is one thing this Umma needs, you can argue, is purification, we need cleaning up.A lot of dirty laundry inside ourselves, inside the nafs, inside this greedy selves of ours and out as a community also.We have our act to clean up.So Allah aza awzal says by reciting this Quran on to the people is cleansing them, is purifying them.I want to discuss purification in two ways.Usually when we are thinking of purification we are thinking something spiritual.You have to do a lot of dhikir to get tazkia, when tazkia discussed we think of it in spiritual sense.But also there is a purification of how you think.Your attitudes.How you look at something.Young men in special, you guys go out there.Muslim or not, it doesn’t even matter, you go out there and you are constantly presented with choices.And you are constantly presented with opportunity.Whether it’s what career you’re gonna pick or whether you are gonna look at the girl crossing the street or not or whether you are gonna check something on your phone or not, you are constantly presented with choices.And towards each of these choices you have an attitude.You have an attitude about money, you have an attitude about a car, you an attitude about where you live.You have attitude towards your parents, you have attitude towards your friends.All of these attitudes and the way you think about things, the Quran came to direct them.It came so we can think about something in a certain way.The way Allah wants us to think.It’s not so much about knowledge.Knowledge is later.Training your heart to think is more important.Training you and me how to think.This is purification.How do we think about the world around us!What do we understand to be beneficial and what do understand to be harmful?You know there are students, to give you a similar example of that.There are students that study medicine.And they smoke!It’s incredible, isn’t it?They study medicine and they are tough students.They get 100 in every exam.And after the exam they get stressed out and go outside of the hall and they are smoking.“You study medicine man! Don’t you know what that will do to your lungs?”And he will say, “Yea I know! I know what it does to my lings! it damages my lungs. I know I am taking 7 minutes out of my life with every single …I kill. ”He knows.“Why do you do it?”“I don’t know!”The knowledge is there but the attitude is not there.Yes, he has convinced himself that it is harmful.He is not …knowledge alone is not enough.Purification means we clean up our attitudes.Not just what we know.A lot of times you are given advice and the first response in your mind is, “Yeah I know, I know man! I know! I know that already”Even though you are doing the wrong thing you are going to tell “I know, I know!”It’s as though, Islam is important for me all over again.Nobody’s asking you to know all over again.You already know but purification means you need to change your attitude.That’s why you and I need reminder all the time.Constantly!If someone gets up and starts giving khutba about Suratul Asr.You are like, “Man I have heard Suratul Asr like thousand times. I already know this. Give me something new.”May be you know it but it hasn’t changed your attitude about spending time.May be your attitude is not fixed yet.This is purification.It has to happen constantly like your car change constantly.You and I need cleansing constantly.That’s what this conference is put in place.The other purification of kurs is purification in nature.The Quran makes you think about life.How do you spend your days?When do you wake up?What’s the first thing you do when you wake up?What do you do in your free time?Are you one of those people that can’t even sit still for 2 minutes and then subhan Allah, the moment you have couple of seconds you grab hold of your cell phone and start knocking down the buildings in angry birds.Is that what you have become?Can’t even help yourself and you become a zombie that plays 99 games!It’s taken over your life.There are some people that are that pathetic!They are!Are you that person that can’t help themselves to check their facebook status every 30 seconds?And every time someone puts a thumbs up you go like “oh! I am worth something as human being now! Finally!”You know!That’s what you’ve reduced yourself to?This is also that is something that is destroying our hearts.Quran came to give us the sense of purpose.How to prioritize, where should I be spending my time?What are the things that I should delete off of my phone?What is taken away from my life?Every single day, what do we have 25,00o days on this planet on average, for every human being?Been taken away day by day!What you gonna do with those days?What are we going to do with that time?This is purification.After this purification, after some of these experience to change in attitude because that is all you can do in Jum’a.Jum’a is like 25-30 minutes, this khutba?You know in khutba you can’t teach much!Nobody can.All we can do is share a reminder.May be we will able to change your attitude about something and after that may be then you are willing to learn.So Allah’s Messenger, we learn about Allah’s Messenger  Sallellahu Alahihe wa Sallam in this Ayah.First he introduces the people to the Quran.As a means of it…he claims his people.Their attitudes and how they think about their life, their hearts.And then, he teaches them the book and the wisdom.You know, reading something to someone, is a one way thing.But teaching someone is a two way thing.For teaching someone has to sit there and pay attention.This is not right now, this now teaching.Teaching means I have to ask you questions, I have to give you tests, I have to make sure that you earned it. It’s two way stream.But until people have changed their attitude, there is no benefit in teaching them because they don’t want to learn.Apply this even to our children, we offer our children Islamic education, we are gonna put them behind a Sheikh, he is gonna give them a talk and every thing’s gonna get better.No. no. no!First thing we need is to change our is the attitude.Until the attitude is changed learning is useless.It’s useless entirely.You know.There are people that go to school and they don’t want to go to school and they do terrible.Why?Because they don’t want to.Attitude isn’t there.But then Allah says, and then after that, once the attitude is fixed, now become an Ummah of learning.Then He teaches the book and the wisdom.Now we become an educated and reformed Ummah.This is the spirit of Jum’a.Every single Firday, you and I are supposed to get rejuvenated in our relationship with the Quran.There is no nation in the world, no nation in the world.There are nations far bigger than ours population.Four times our size.Five times our size of other religions but they don’t have the kind of gathering that we have on Friday.We don’t even realize.Many of us don’t even know each other sitting in this audience.We don’t know each other.We are of different countries and different backgrounds and that is one of the amazing things about the United States.There must be like fifty countries in this hall right now.Sitting next side by side.We don’t speak each other’s language but there is one thing bringing us together.That’s that one invitation from Allah Azawjal.“Rush to the remembrance of Allah”.Allah created a reunion of all Muslims every single Friday.When we talk about how come the Muslims are not united, how come we don’t take advantage of Friday unit with each other at least?And we say slam to one person next.And we get to know at least one Muslim sitting next to you.This is how unity is built.Unity is built just over talking on micro phone saying we need to be one. Allah physically put us together every Friday!Physically!And this is something we need to reflect upon and think about.How we take advantage of this colossal opportunity.In the end in sha Allahu ta’ala what I want to share with you, is something I personally feel, it should be shared over and over again across all Muslims. Don’t underestimate the power of the Quran in your life.Doesn’t matter who you are, how much you know, how much you don’t know.Myself even!When Allah aza auwjal gives a reminder in book, you try to learn it, you try to understand it.Try to benefit from I shared with you Suratul Jum’a.Right!The 62 suraOne of the easiest things you can do is go on and read it.First read the Arabic, if you don’t know the Arabic, just pick up a translation.Which translation?Whatever you have at home.Read something.Get closer to Quran.Share it with the wife.Share it with the husband.Share it with the children.This is what Allah says.What you remember from the Khutba?Let’s a talk about it a little more.As a family, you should get closer to Quran.This is the way to do it.Allah put lot of Baraka in this day so we should try and do that in sha Allahu ta’ala.And slowly but surely, as the Arabs said, the first thing to happen, first you feel the drop and then it goes crazy.It’s like with the Quran.May be its one ayah today.One little reminder tomorrow.But over time and really deep relationship with Quran.Don’t underestimate these little things.And don’t underestimate the value of them, especially when they are with your family.How many times your father gave you advice?Something he said about Islam.You don’t remember all of the speeches and all of the talks you sat through or all the Khutbas you sat through but your father gave you a bit of advice that is still in your head.“You know my dad told me one time,…this, this, this.”Don’t underestimate when you give advice to your children.They remember stuff.The speeches especially if it comes from you.They value those things.May Allah az awzal make us individuals and families closer and closer to the Quran every single Friday.May Allah Aza awzal give ourselves the leaders, the du’a, the Khatib a sense of responsibility that we are supposed to be delivering in appreciation of the Quran.And the Messenger of Allah Sallellahu Alaihe wa sallam.May Allah aza awzal make us of those whose sins and forgiven and they are able to make sincere tawba to Allah  And stay away from their sins an as the days go by they only get closer and closer to Allah and not further and further away.May Allah Azauzal help us get away from our addictions to entertainment.May Allah aza awzal help us appreciate our time on this earth is limited and that it should not be wasted away with things that have no benefit here and no benefit in the next life.May Allah aza awzal give us love of useful activities, useful times spent with in the worship of Allah or in learning beneficial things and in sharing beneficial things with one another and making ourselves better people for His sake.Barak Allah dewalakum fir Quranil hakim
