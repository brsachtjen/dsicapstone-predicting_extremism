 Khutbah titled“Accompany the Truthful” delivered by Ustadh Nouman Ali KhanThursday, 05 December 2013Published in BayyinahAudioLibrary, Khutbahs, Nouman Ali KhanArabic speech, opening of the Khutba                                  Today In Shaa Allah wa Taala I want to share with you some lessons from 3 ayat maybe 4 ayat that belonging to sura At Tawba And little bit of a context is important for us to get some more benefits from this few minutes that we have together , sura At Tawba most of it is what is revealed towards the very end of the life of the Prophet  , sallAllahu Aleyhy wa sallam  ,and the history of the ayat, the context of these  ayat  are  towards the end of the Sirah ,so the last few years of the Messenger ,  Aleyhy Salatul wa sallam     ,and a lot of these suras  actually has to do  with the conquest of  Makkah ,   Fath , Makkah , and the punishment that should come to the Quraysh , in other words this struggle of   Rasull Allah , sallAllahu Aleyhy wa sallam ,   and the sahaba ,Radi Allahu Taala agimain ,over two  decades of gone ,of struggles  , ups and downs , when  they were  in Mekkah you don’t even know if  they are all going to survive or not because the Makkans are , or the Quraysh are an unstoppable power compare to the Muslims they are just a handful they don’t have anything, and is even miraculous the way they escape  from Makkah…you know,,, if you ask a politician or you know even  a political   science expert or military expert …”these people   are going to survive or not ?” …they will say: “ no there is no chance this people can survive”  …”they goanna   be executed” , but somehow   ,  they survive in Medina and even in Medina there are all kinds of problems is not that is  only solutions in Medina , there’s  its own challenges  in Medina ,and not even six month go by and we have to go head to head with the Makkan powers again ,and the struggles continuo, between the Muslims and the Quraish and also  the internal challenges of medina and one impossible odd after another and the help of Allah keeps on coming .Until finally the most unexpected thing actually   even the entire Arabia did not expect , that the Quraish will ever  be overpowered …that did not…  was not expected ,,,you know ?And even that Allah give the Muslims and they are able to overpower finally   after all that struggle this you can call it : “ The Super Power tribe of the region the Quraysh “ . But you know what?Even from the Madani life of the Prophet , Aleyhi sallatul wa sallam ,  he started sending letters to real superpowers:  the Persians, and the Romans , they started to ,,,,,, people started to receive letters from the Messenger of Allah sallAllahu Aleyhy wa sallam  an Invitation to Islam.And if you just compare within the desert of Arabia, Makkans are a big deal ,nobody wants to mess with Quraish , cose’ they are the super power But if you put that in prospective of the Romans and the Persians and the great empires of that time even the Makkans they’re nothing , they are like flies they have no comparison to the army of the Romans and the army of the Persians , so for the Muslims defeating the mekkans was a big deal , was a huge problem for them with respect to the  region.But when the conflict began and there is news that the Romans were actually are gathering their  armies  and not to soon after we goanna find out that there is goanna be even  coming  after the horizon conflict with the Persians  which are massive , massive armies I mean their armies are bigger than the population …of the Muslims , their armies alone. Not even civilians comparing to   civilians there is not even a comparison I can’t even use the phrase apples and oranges cose I’d doesn’t work here …this is apples and fourths of water melons ,,you know there’s no comparison So now the Muslims feel finally they have got some victory, they finally able to clean the house of Allah, and   victory came in all over the sudden and a new problem is introduced , and the size of this problem is nothing like what they’ve ever seen before.Nothing!There’s not even any comparison to any challenge they faced in their entire history to this problem.And this is towards the end of the struggle, you know when you finally win, you finally seem to …. feel like the problems are over …” haaaa”  you can take a breath of fresh air and say: “ ok is over now!” , well actually is just getting started, and is getting started in a way that the real challenges now ..Sobhan Allah , Sobhan Allah And on top of this when the news came that …you know ? … this massive army of the Romans is actually  uniting  and gathering it’s forces, and is heading towards the Messenger sallAllahu Aleyhy wa sallam    and the Muslims instead of defending the city  , the instruction comes from the Rasull Allah sallAllahu Aleyhy wa sallam    ,”  let’s go after them ! Instead of fortifying our city while we are strongest lets gather everyone let’s have a general draft of the Muslims gather our forces and meet the enemy. Let’s go meet the enemy.”This is an incredible; I mean you would even say   for      at a foot soldier level …” Are we crazy ?   Is that what we‘re really goanna do? We goanna go out and meet with them ? Nobody fights with them, nobody touches them!And they are coming after us, now we’re goanna go after them?” This does not even make any sense, so they were all kinds of Muslims right? They were the Muslims  - samiana wa atana -  they said: “If Allah can give us victory over the Makkans , (who everybody thought it was impossible ), so what is the big deal? …I don’t care if they were 100 times bigger or a 1000 times bigger or a million times bigger , it  doesn’t matter the help didn’t come from us ,the victory  didn’t come from us ,it came from   Allah ,so we trust Allah ,and we trust His Messenger sallAllahu Aleyhy wa sallam  , “ so we’re going , we’re going “ others said “ how we can go ? There’s goanna be really hard !” and Allah made a call to the Muslims , open call , this is unlike any other battles in the past : Ya ayyuha allatheena amanoo  itha qeela lakumu infiroo fee sabeeli Allahi  Ith thaqaltum ila al-ard  (9:38) Sura At Tawba again: “Those of you who have iman when you’re told march forward in Allah’s way your feet get planted into the earth? , what’s the matter with you …malakum ? Why aren’t you   moving forward?”“radeetum bilhayatiaddunya mina al-akhirati … “ You   happy with this life as opposed to the next ? You think you signed up for Islam for this life or next life?  What wad you thinking? “You think this was goanna be really a “cake walk “and you get   to celebrate in this life? This life … the test is goanna continuo..Get your act together, what’s wrong with you?It’s like a wakeup call from Allah Azza wa Jeeal and those ayat, that are earlier in the Sura So when He made that call … the point I’m getting to … this is all the background… this is not   the khutba    today  this is just a background so I can make a couple of points You know ? …. This was the time that at which the sahaba had to live and meet the enemy in battle was also   harvest season, this was the …and if you know anything about farming …harvest season does not happen every month, it happens foe a few weeks, and you better pick the fruits ,and crop ,and harvest, and pick the plants at that time and if you don’t picked up at the right time all the food will go back …and your entire year of  work will be wasted. And allot of the farmers in Medina they actually grew date palms, the palm trees, and you have to climb all the way up on the top of the palm tree to pick the fruits , to pick the dates, so they can’t live the women and the children do that because only the man are skilled to do that ….and now the Messenger is saying sallAllahu Aleyhy wa sallam    :    ,,,” Every capable man has to come to fight .”“ Can we go in two weeks? Can we just pick the fruits first? because that’s all our the entire year of work ?” ...”No no no, you have to come right now , …you have to come right now…”Which Allah calls in Quran in this Sura : “ law kana aradan kareeban “ -    had it been a nearby a gold  - ,,,  - “Just a little bit more ,   give us some time let us get some , get,,, what we need to get ,and then we will go forward” The Messenger say:  - “ No you  have to live now “ , and is staid, death of the heat , death of the heat , so we know that the munafekun the hypocrites didn’t want to go ever they didn’t want to go to Badr  or Uhud  or Ahzab  they don’t  wan’ a   participate in any struggle    , but this was even a struggle that was difficult   for the average believer who wasn’t even a munafek. After all he’s thinking:  “’am goanna go chances are : I am going to die for the sake of Allah , but I know for a fact   my family , who depends on this work , they have no food to eat after two days, if I don’t pick this fruits ,  with their  salaries are not goanna come from  anywhere but  this farm, and I have to trust Allah and I’m going, not only ‘am I trusting him with my life I am putting my entire family livelihood in danger as I am going .” That’s what they’re thinking, is hard, is hard. so you find some sincere Sahaba, sincere Sahaba  who said : “ maybe if I  wait just a little bit,…  I have very fast horses, the Muslims army is goanna leave, there’s goanna be lots of them, and they goanna move slowly,” obviously when thousands of people are marching, they march slowly they don’t march fast , “so I have a fast horse so I can catch up with them,  if I just waited couple of days this is not a big deal, I still can catch up with them” , but you know when they became 2 days became a week became  2…. And they just got left behind       and they realize  …”doesn’t  matter how fast I’m goanna run my horse I’m not catching up with them” , So they missed out the battle and the embarrassment that settle into them, now they are two different kinds …by the way everyone had to present an excuse,  - “ Why didn’t you go,…  why didn’t you go ? “ And the munafekun came back and give back all kinds of excuses they say : “You know I didn’t even know you call, you had an invitation to go??? I had no idea! Nobody send me the e-mail I didn’t even check my phone   my voice mail or nothing I …. Really you guys came   and came back already mabrouk “ , You know? ….Like all kinds of lame excuses. But the Sahaba , and they could’ve made lame  excuses too…because if you make  an  excuse the Messenger    sallAllahu Aleyhy wa sallam  … say’s : “ Ok, I trust you “ and he lets them go , He doesn’t  say :  - “ the munafekun are lying  , you are lying that’s  not a correct excuse” etc … ,  He let their excuses go,  even the lamest excuses.But, you know what ? This Sahaba , the guilt on them was so heavy …they actually come to the Messenger sallAllahu Aleyhy wa sallam    , and they told the truth , they said:  “ actually we’ve could have gone , we could have gone “ “ we don’t have a good excuse “  and  “ we’re humiliated , we’re embarrassed that we’re coming and  telling you this but we cannot to lie to you “ . Allah Azza Wa Jeeal after talking about those 3  Wa alla thalathaty , aladhina khulifu  ---   the tree that were  left behind  , that is the previous aya , in the very next aya not only that Allah forgive them this is the beauty of these ayat , not only that Allah forgive them , He say the aya that I begun this Khutba with He said : (9: 119 )Ya ayyuha allatheena amanooittaqoo Allaha wakoonoo maAAa assadiqeen – Allah say’s : “Those of you who have Iman have Taqwa of Allah . And be with the truthful, be with the truthful. “Now in the context of these ayat the truthful ones were the ones that came to the Messenger sallAllahu Aleyhy wa sallam  ,  and wore not lying about their mistake !They told the truth and they said: “ we are ready to make up for it ! ““We are ready to do what it takes, if you wan’ a punish us we deserve it ““but we want to make this up we would rather face the problems in this life than face Allah in the akhirah . “ They were truthful about that; and Allah appreciates this people, instead of giving us a khutba in the Quran against them…” look at them they got left behind! , look at what they’ve done! , you shouldn’t be like them!”  etc etc ….Allah says : “Have Taqwa of Allah”   , and  “ You should be from the truthful”  in another words  even when you make a mistake be  truthful . That’s a heavy lesson in the Quran………… because even in your families and you know,,, even our children . Sometimes we get very angry on our children , and children , you know , they are very smart …, they are very smart , so when the parents get angry at them, the next time they make the same  mistake, and the mother says:  -  “ Did you go there ? “ - “Did you touched that? “ The child actually goes through a calculation process: “ If I say yes , I remember last time I got in pretty big trouble  for touching it, and if  I say:  No! ,  maybe I will get in trouble  , maybe she’ll believe me,  50 / 50  chance I will get in trouble . so the truth definitely will get me in trouble ,and the lie maybe be , maybe not “ “ so I’m goanna get my chances and I’m goanna lie, “ No mother I didn’t touch it “  “ tell me the truth did you touch it ? “ “ No no no I swear I didn’t touch it “,,,” I didn’t touch it “ The children are very smart they run that calculation.    That’s the same calculation every Sahabi who has to present himself before Rasull Allah sallAllahu Aleyhy wa sallam  ,  is goanna have, if I tell him:  - “I got lazy …I got scared   … I wasn’t strong enough to go to the  ... the battle ,  to fight in the sake of Allah”  then obviously there’s goanna be punishments ,there goanna be consequences ,but if I lie to him maybe there is  consequences maybe there’s no  consequences, but they know, that is not just  the Messenger they have to convince sallAllahu Aleyhy wa sallam  ,  it is Allah Azza wa Jeeal   they have to convince, and there’s no lying that you can save from Allah ,so they stick to the truth ...this was actually  a prove of their  Iman and Allah love that so much that he is telling us : -  “Anyone who makes a mistake, be honest, be truthful don’t hide behind lies, don’t make excuses and don’t come up with creative words to justify what you did “ Allot of the children upstairs that are listening I know   the school kids are listening a lot of you … you don’t.. You say … - “I don’t lie to my parents” , and you tell to yourself you don’t lie but you know what you do ! You know what you really do, and Allah knows what you really do. You have to be from those who are truthful: “   Ya ayyuha allatheena amanooittaqoo Allaha wakoonoo maAAa assadiqeen “Then that is the last few minutes that I have with you … I want to share with you something more, beyond this that …  wallahy if you  internalize, your view of what is happening today in the world changes .There is enough depressing news in the world today, what is happening to our families our brothers and sisters our fathers our mothers …you know …our sons and daughters in Syria, what’s happening to them in Egypt, what’s happening to them in Burma, what’s happening to them all over the Ummah , I mean we  see  video footage from all over the world and is heart breaking  is heart wrenching  what the Muslims are going through , what the world is going through …..Right?  , so if you want be depressed about the state of the world you don’t even have to keep up with the news to much  you just hear  5 min of the news and you get  enough to depressed for one year , right ? This is the state of our Ummah this is the state of the world today. But you know what? the perception from the Iman if different …you see … I just told you that the Sahaba were facing a problem bigger  than anything  they had ever faced before , bigger than anything  they had ever faced before, and the means that they had to try to solve that problem are incomparable there’s no comparison really…. they don’t have the means to face the Romans,  they don’t , there’s no calculations  you  can make , that they will be able to fight with the Romans , a soldier to 300 according to some calculations …at  best 1 to 30 ,   in worse case 1 to 300 that’s ridiculous odds  for one soldier   it’s absurd , that’s 1 soldier taking on a army. ..:)  Sobhan Allah .But yet Allah help came, yet Allah’s help came …we have to be a people that see all of our problems as challenges that are entirely under Allah’s control, and He is only putting us through them …(67:2)”  liyab luwakumay yukum ahsanu ama la_”  … so He can test you which one of you rises to the occasion , which one of you rises   to the occasion .Now I said all of this for you to conclude this khutba on this one aya … I am skipping an aya because of the shortage of time …but this one aya …Sobhan Allah …. ( 9:121) Wala yunfiqoona nafaqatan sagheeratan wala kabeeratan …  these people they don’t spend anything small ,the believers ,they don’t spend anything small or anything big   except …so Allah is mentioning small sadaka and big sadaka , in this aya , small sadaka and big sadaka , and when  you think of sadaka in fact don’t just think of money I mean when they were going out they were giving up a year salary was money but there was also risking their lives,  and you know …think about this … : what are they goanna give for the sake of Allah to prepare against the Rom…. the mighty Roman army  , the mighty Roman   , what they goanna give ???... They goanna give a date ? a sword ? a horse ? How is that   goanna make any difference? So Allah begins with sagheera ….” Wala yunfiqoona nafaqatan sagheeratan” .. they will not give the smallest bit of sadaka    and you know  when you say  anfaq , the master , the infinitive expected is anfaaq , “Wala yunfiqoona anfaqaan sagheeran”  but Allah said : “nafaqatan sagheeratan”      This is in Arabic what is called    : mastar mara : what it means  in simple English for the rest of you ..  Is a single act of charity, a single expense …in another word they are so poor …that they can’t even spend more than once ….. Once they give.. They look back in the bank, there’s nothing left    And even that is small ,the one thing they could give is small …..” walaka”  …and even if it was big  , even if it was big …now from my calculations would not make any difference , but what Allah does say ? : “  wala yaqtaAAoona wadiyan “ and there’s not a single valley that they are going to cross, there’s not a step that they are going to take,…. like in the previous aya He says :9:120  “wala yataoonamawti-an yagheethu alkuffara” they are not going to trample their feet , you know when you are getting really tired your foot gets heavy ,….? so when you step on the ground gets heavier your steps …right  ??? Is an expression of exhaustion Allah says : “ when they’re walking , when   you walk earlier when you start your walk  your feet are light “ you move quickly,   as you get heavier your steps gets slower This is called wataa in Arabic ,  to trample  , to really have heavy feet , which means you’re exhausted… Allah says even in the previous aya …”every single step that they take” . now He says “ every single valley that they cross “   “ illa kutiba lahum”  it was recorded for them ,Allah is rewarding them for it ,Allah is paying them for it.They are not moving towards the Roman army because they are going to defeat the Roman army, they are moving towards the Romans because : “Kalla Rasull Allah, sallAllahu aleyhi wa sallam,   samiana wa ata’na “  - we hear, and we obey!”  - and when they do that Allah says : “ I will pay you , I will pay you , but I will pay you for that little thing you gave and the big thing   you gave and every step that you took and every valley that you passed by and today of course in taxi’s we don’t have no valleys  right ? …flat land  …so every mile marker you’ve passed every building you pass every exit you pass is being recorded …by Allah. Every step you take for the sake of Allah ….there’s not one you’ve taken    that hasn’t been recorded. What is this do? What is that do to the Muslims? What we do for the sake of Allah is being recorded by Allah??? Why?  “liyajziyahum   “  so that He can pay them .9;121 “ liyajziyahumu Allahu ahsanama kanoo yaAAmaloon  “ , so He can pay them with the best of what they use to do …Sobhan Allah …what a beautiful aya ! You know when we do something for the sake of Allah , sometimes we do really well and sometimes is not   so good,, sometimes your salat ( prayer) is really good,.. sometimes it wasn’t so good, sometime you make a really good wudu ( abolution ) sometimes you didn’t make a good wudu , you have a good days and bad days , Allah says : “ when you do this for me in front of odds that are impossible “ …when you see the … na,,,  - “how can my little effort can make any difference ! ?”But you don’t care because you’re doing it for Allah, that’s all you’re doing it for, Allah will take the best of what you did and will reward you based on the best of what you did .I want you to understand what that’s means. You know …..Again they’re students listening to the khutba , you have …you know you’re doing  math this semester or this quarter and you have five exams , one exam you got a  100 , all the other exams you failed .You all know that student will not pass that grade. If they got 100 on one exam and they fail all the other exams .Is not good …not enough to pass …Allah is saying : “ if you did one with a 100…” and then everything else was 20 , 10 , 15 , He’s  not goanna average all of it  , He will take the one you got the 100 and based all of your reward based on the 100…. Sobhan Allah . He’ll count the best thing you did and He’ll based the rewards on that. For people who’s have hopes with Allah, who’re optimistic with Allah and then the victory comes …! People that have that kind of trust in Allah   pass the test . They understand that there’re two worlds the world that they can see and the world that they cannot see. The help and the calculations that they can make and the calculations   they cannot make…and  “Allahu yarzuku man ya shaa wa bi ghairil hisab “…I am sharing this khutba with you   because very recently Al Hamdulillah actually yesterday I came back from a long…bit of travel. I had the opportunity to visit 3 countries, and meet some Muslim communities in Malaysia and Singapore and Bahrain, and as I meet these communities   Sobhan Allah I was shocked!!!I am really still in sock! At something about United States   …   not even about them, I go there and they say: “ How’s  Imam Yaser Birjas doing ,he’s in Dallas right?”  And what about sheich Abdul Nasir and Kadam institute? And, how are your dream students doing their studies on the 15…???” …., and random people they know everything that’s going on with us over here …  everything! All of our Daees, …”Imam Salaj ...how’s Imam Salaj doing?  , how’s Sheickh Hamza Yousef doing?  , how’s Dr. Yasir Qadhi… he’s in Memphis Tennessee, do you get the chance to meet him much? , because we follow him allot over here “ …..Sobhan Allah …young people, old people …!!! We ,  we  just think we’re  goanna do a dars ( lesson) here , and a lecture here , teach  a class   here, make an small effort just put it up on a YouTube , leave it … , leave am Mp3 download or something …and Sobhan Allah...is nothing for us …a small effort, is not even an effort ,and when Allah wants to put Baraka in it … when Allah …..These people on the other side of the planet …I mean you can’t have more time difference between us and the Malaysians… is 12 hours , ,  they are on the other side of the planet  And they’re following our work! And they’re benefiting from the Dawa efforts from those that are putting the work in …you know that gives you? ….It gives you hope, it gives you hope ,   that no effort that the Muslims makes, is worthless , no effort he makes or she makes,  Allah will just let it go !!! , not in the akhira and not in this dunia not one step that we take!                                 So we should not underestimate the efforts that we have ,we should not overwhelm ourselves with problems…..” -  Oh there’re so many problems …the Ummah is just, you know! “  So many reasons to be depressed but there are so many reasons to be happy, so many reasons to be optimistic, so many reasons to move forward, so many reasons to feel like …” Ya Allah , I’m ready to do work , put me to work “  …………and I am telling you we are privileged ,we’re privileged to live in the kind of luxury , and the kind of opportunity : educational opportunities  ,carrier opportunities, living opportunities,   financial  opportunities ,that we do .We are privileged by Allah , and when we have that kind of privileged we better put that to service of His Deen …you know ! We better do something for this deen , we should not just live for ourselves we should live for this deen you all have to think about that :Is not just activist and volunteers at the majids and the duat and the Khatib , and the volunteers , those are the people that do something for the deen of Allah the rest of us just come and pray , actually …because you signed up with :  “ La ilaha illa Allah “  ,,,,Allah expects more from each of you . He doesn’t want you to live just for  yourself , He want you to live for His Deen  too, He wants’ you to do something for it .  He wants’ you to be a contributor and I pray that Allah Azza wa Jeeal truly make all of us contributors… that are constantly thinking about how they can do , how they can build their home for Allah …you know …their home with   Allah Azza wa Jeeal  for themselves and their families .I pray that this Ummah and its challenges are lifted ,and I pray that Allah Azza wa Jeeal makes us of those ….puts Baraka in the efforts , all the efforts that we are doing , that he puts Baraka in  them  , that good comes for the Ummah and for the world thru it  , may Allah Azza wa jeeal accept our efforts and overlook the mistakes that we have and  the things that we do .
