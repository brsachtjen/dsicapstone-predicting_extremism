A believer’s response to Burning of the QuranNouman Ali KhanLecture 1I wanted to share a passage from Surah Ali Imran which is very relevant and extremely pertinent through the kinds of situations Muslims are facing in regards  to the  construction of masajids in certain places, in regards to how certain Christian groups are celebrating the desecration of Allah’s book and these are painful things to hear over and over again. We shouldn’t be surprised or hurt by these actions actually.The People that don’t believe and especially those that have animosity against Muslims and Islam, they have certain principles that they live by and we have certain principles we live by, the principles of Islam.But when it comes to dealing with the Muslims, and when it comes to dealing with Islam you will find the forces of kufr (disbelief) will compromise their own principles.The Quraysh would never attack one of their own – they would never do so and were willing to spill blood when it comes to one of their own, they will never consider expelling one of their own  except when it came to Muhammed sal. because tribe comes before everything. Tribe is everything.  For the Quraysh their religion is their tribe. But when it comes to dealing with the Muslims they are willing to compromise that principle.For Firaun attacking someone who was raised in his household is humiliating – he will never do so except when he has to compromise his own principle against Musa Al. he is willing to do so So we shouldn’t be surprised. Kazalika Thughyaan - This is how all forces of rebellion are. This is how they are.  This is what we should expect. This is what Allah has taught us to expect.So Instead of worrying about what they are doing, we should be more concerned about what we are doing, what is our responsibility, what are we supposed to be doing.This ayat is to do with the battle of Uhud. But the Ayat has universal lessons in them3:172 Those who answered (the call of) Allah and the Messenger after being wounded; for those of them whodid good deeds and feared Allah, there is a great reward”Story of Uhad and the rumour about the Quraysh coming back and prophet sal. asking them to go back and defend themselves)Even after they were injured – this is specifically talking about the Battle of Uhud when the Muslims had suffered extreme injury and defeat and the Quraysh had left then a rumour spread that the Quraysh are coming for round two cos they are thinking Muslims are injured and might as well come and finish them off. And the Messenger is turning to the companions who’s morale is gone, they have suffered enormous defeat and he tells them “let’s go after them instead of them coming after us – with our injured soldiers we are going”.  Even at that point some sahaba got up and said let’s go.  And Allah says “ those who responded even after injury had touched them, those who had excelled from among them and displayed excellent character and stood by the Messenger”.  And it says Wattha-qau it not only demonstrates they are  committed to the Messenger they also feared Allah.  They didn’t fear the enemy. And for them Allah says there’s ajran azeem - there is enormous reward.3:173 Those (i.e. believers) to the people (hypocrites) said “verily the people (pagans) have gathered against you (a great army), therefore fear them”.  But it only increased them in Faith and they said “Allah alone is sufficient for us and He is the Best Disposer of Affairs” (hasbunallahi wa ni’mal wakeel”People around them said this to them, the hypocrites said this to them, People of the Book said this to them  - People are gathered up against you, you should be afraid of them, this is what the Muslims were being told.  People are rallying against you, the numbers are against you, forces are gathering about you all standing against you, you should be afraid of that, you should worried.What did Allah say : fazaadahum imanan wa qaalu hasbunallahu ni’mal wakeel But it only increased them in Faith and they said “Allah alone is sufficient for us and He is the Best Disposer of Affairs” When they heard these words that they should be worried about the people are against us and are gathering against us it increased them in their Iman even more and Then they responded by saying Allah is enough for us hasbunallahu wa ni’mal wakeel Our affairs, our matters, the one taking care of us is not our strategy  it is Allah, He is enough for usSo for a true believer this is a situation when Iman goes up instead of going down.  Their depression goes away.  They are reminded of Allah.3:174 so they returned with grace and bounty from Allah.  No harm touched them and they followed the good pleasure of Allah. And Allah is the Owner of Great Bounty.Because of that, then therefore, because they said that Allah returned them with the blessing of Allah and no harm touched them at all.  They were pursuing only the pleasure of Allah, the favour of Allah Instead of pursuing their protection, they were pursuing in making Allah happy and that was the concern they had.  And because of that Allah says and Allah Himself is the possessor of the great favour.Before we talk about a strategy on how to respond to these kinds of criticisms and these kinds of attacks in the media and these kinds of atrocious behavior towards the Muslims and attacks on masajid, before we even begin to understand how to respond the first thing that has to respond is the heart of the believer.Because until the heart o the believer is not turned towards Allah, Allah’s help does not come and Allah’s guarantee that harm will not touch you that does not come until we from the bottom of our hearts say hasbunallahi wa ni’mal wakeel We no longer fear these attacksUntil that happens we cannot expect the help of Allah. And until that happens no matter what strategies we make and what media responses we  come up with, what press releases we do, it will not help because that is not the formula of Allah’s book. 3:175 It is only Shaitan that suggests to you the fear of his auliya (supporters and friends) so fear them not, but fear Me, if you are true believersThat in fact was satan instilling fear into you of his friends. When people came to you and said you should be worried, you should be afraid, you should be worried, that wasn’t people, that was shaytanThe Ultimate goal of shaytan is to remove you and me from Allah and he wants to instill in you and me fear of other than Allah. That’s what he wants to do.so fear them not, but fear Me, if you are true believersIf in fact there is iman inside you this fear shouldn’t even exist inside you3: 176 And let not those grieve you (o Muhammed) who rush with haste to disbelieve; verily not the least harm will they do to Allah.  This is the word of Allah revealed at the time of the messenger and it seems like Allah is addressing our situation Don’t let those who are making a lot of efforts in the agenda of kufr, in the agenda of disbelief against Islam, against iman, those who make these efforts don’t let them worry you and he tells this to his messenger sal. and by extension all of us.  Don’t let them worry you.Innahu lai yadurrallaha shaiyaThey for sure will never hurt Allah at allYou have your hopes and expectation with Allah and they cant cause Allah any harm, what are you worried about ? why are you afraid, what’s stressing you outIt is Allah’s Will to give them no portion in the Hereafter.  For them there is a great tormentNow Allah tells us How does Allah allows them to make efforts in the way of Kufr and does not even punish them and they continue to do more and more transgressions against Allah’s Dheen.  Yureedunallaha al-laa yaj’ala  hazzan fil akhiraAllah intends that they don’t even have a single portion in the HereafterIn other words Allah lets them go. You wanna dig your hole deeper, go ahead so you get nothing at all - there is no ounce of Mercy that you are worthy of in the next lifeWalahum azabun azeemAnd for them is great punishment3:177 verily those who purchase disbelief at the price of faith, not the least harm will they do to Allah.  For them there is a painful torment.Also those who purchased disbelief in exchange for belief - They will not be able to harm Allah eitherTwo groups are mentioned here – one is the group of hypocrites (they claim to believe but they don’t believe, inside they don’t fear Allah, they fear people). Basically they sold their iman for kufr even though it doesn’t look like it on the outside. We cannot judge the inside we can see only the inside but Allah knows the inside and He knows whom he is talking about. The other is many people in flocks are using this situation in hopes of gaining some eligibility in society.  Several cases where people have left Islam.  They haven’t left Islam for intellectual reasons, but there is some benefit and some agenda that they are looking for (eg. a guy who used to be a Muslim and became a Christian because he had immigration problems). You’ll find these people too.The word Muslim is the new ‘n’ word in America.  Originally when the elections where happening a survey was done and 10% - 18 % thought he was a Muslim. They were that paranoid “o my god what if he is a Muslim”.  So the White House had to give a press release that “no he is a devout Christian he prays everyday to Christ”. Why?  Because they think Islam is something dirty and disgusting.  But if a synagogue is being built, or a church, or hindu temple or an atheist centre is being built, they wouldn’t care less.  But when the House of Allah is being built forget freedom of religion. Forget tolerance and the land of co-existence. Forget these empty slogans.We should be angry about this.But at the same time we should know where to place our hopes3:178 and let not the disbelievers think that Our postponing of their punishment is good for them.  We postpone the punishment only so that they may increase in sinfulness.  And for them is a disgraceful tormentThe opportunities that Allah has given them to do more and more against this dheen they think this is a good opportunity.  Allah didn’t say great punishment this time, He says humiliating punishment. 3:179 Allah wil not leave the believers in the state in which you are now, until he distinguishes the wicked from the good.  Nor will Allah disclose to you the secrets of the unseen.  But Allah chooses of His Messengers whom He wills.  So believe in Allah and His Messengers.  And if you believe and fear Allah then for you there is a great rewardNow Allah turns his attention to the believersThe way you are He is not gonna leave you like that.  Why? in other words the Muslims are all one big body but when tough times comes, they the hypocrites will be removed from our ranks, they will sell their iman for Kufr and finally the filth will be removed  and only the good pure will remain.  You and I are going through difficult times because this is Allah’s way of cleansing the Ummah.  Allah will not leave you the way you until the filthy is removed from the pure and the way to do that is to put us through difficulty.This is something Allah talks about even with the Sahaba.  (Example of Battle of Uhud).  It is not that Allah loves wrong doers.  Example of burning gold to removing impurities – you have to burn gold to remove its impurities you cant scrub it out, you have to burn it.  Allah gives that analogy for the believers – until you are burned, put under extreme circumstances, until the hypocrisy within you will be removed, until then you will suffer. Trials are a purification for this Ummah.Allah is not One to give you the news of the unseen either.  Some people say when are these troubles going to end. This is from the ghaib. This is not your problem. Don’t worry about it.  Allah will never give you that news.But Allah chooses of His Messengers whom He wills.  When times becomes difficult hold on to the legacy of the believers.So believe in Allah and His Messengers.  And if you believe and fear Allah then for you there is a great rewardIf you are patient, if you are cautious, then for you there will be a great reward.Allah takes a situation which is negative and He now makes us think about the great reward.  He. is changing a negative situation into a positive situation What’s the opposite?3:186 You shall certainly be tried and tested in your wealth and properties and in your personal selves, No doubt about it, you are all going to be tested in your monies and yourselves. Your money will be in danger and your self will be in danger. You will feel these trials financially and socially – fee amwaalikum wa anfusikum. and you shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who received the Scripture before you (Jews and Christians) You will definitely, no doubt about it hear from those who were given the scripture before i.e. the Jews and the Christians and from those who ascribe partners to Allah,here He is talking about the Qurayshno doubt about it you will get azan kaseera… a lot of painful words. You will get to hear a lot of painful words from them.  Do we hear that a lot today? Are they saying horrendous things about the Book of Allah? About the Messenger of Allah sal.? about the Muslims in general?  They will come out and say all Muslims are terrorists.  And the ones that aren’t terrorists they will say that these people are lying to protect the terrorists. And we have to hear these things.Allah says what should be your reaction?  This is where we have to be harsh on ourselves.Muslims nowadays have become nothing but emotional puppets – they know exactly how we are going to respond. And they do things to us so we work exactly according to plan. We come out and burn a couple of cars, or protest and yell and scream. We don’t act in a calm, collected, calculated fashion which is how Allah’s messenger sal. did.When you hear empty rhetoric like this, these attacks against Islam, what should you do?  Allah Himself says :   but if you persevere patiently and become Al-Muttaqun then verily that will be a determining factor in all affairs.And if you are able to be patient, patient actually means controlling your emotions, holding yourself back and continuing to fear Allah then this is of the most noble deeds you can do.  Our patience speaks volumes. Our yelling and screaming is more detrimental.After we are patient what are we supposed to do?We are supposed to be patient.  We are supposed to continue to have taqwa of Allah.But we can talk about how important it is for our masajid to represent the teachings of our dheen, to educate our local communities. It’s an absolute critical job of every masjid and if not every Muslim to at represent the teachings of their dheen in their vicinity, among their core workers, with their business partners, with their friends.And if they are unable to do that, the masjid is supposed to help you. Its purpose is to help educate people about the teachings of this Dheen, about removing the fear that shaythan has  put inside them of this religion. This is not new. Shaytan did this during the time of the Messenger sal. too.The Quraysh would go around saying don’t listen tot his man, you’ll go crazy, if you listen to him your family will be destroyed, he’ll do magic on you. They would instill fear in the population.  So don’t fear the population.  That’s just shaythan doing his job. We just have to do a better job.  We have to clarify this dheen.So in this regard, why must we clarify dheen?He tells us something very serious about the people of the BookIn Surah Al Baqara Allah says “no doubt it those who continue to hide what We have sent them from the clear proofs and guidance even after We have clarified it in the Book for the people”Allah says I sent a Book down with proofs and guidance and there are some people who are hiding it.  What happens to them?  “Those are the people whom Allah Himself curses and there are those who are created just to curse them” Ulema comment that these are angelsAllah creates specific Angels whose only job is to curse people who hide what Allah has sent down.  Apparently it seems like its talking to the people of the BookWhat’s the opposite?Allah says : Illallazeena thaabu wa aslahu, wa baiyyanu Two things have been said On the one hand is people hiding the bookAnd on the other side those who repented (thaabu) and corrected their behavior (aslahu) and clarified the Book (wa baiyyanu)Unless we are people of Tauba, and we correct ourselves and we clarify this Book, we clarify the religion unless we do that, we are guilty of the opposite which is hiding the Book Either you are hiding the Book or you are Clarifying.  There’s no in between.  I don’t talk about it that doesn’t mean am hiding it.  Yes it is. Because Allah only gave 2 options. You can either be from group A or Group b. Group A is whom Allah curses and Angels are created specifically to curse themBut then there are those who realize that they need to be making tauba to Allah, they need to be correcting their behavior and then they need to be clarifying this religion What a beautiful sequence.  First you fix your relationship with Allah, then you fix yourself (Aslahu), you fix your own character.  How are you going to talk about Islam to people if you don’t do anything to represent Islam? You have to correct yourself, you have to fix your character. And then you clarify this Book (wa baiiyanu).Ulaa-ika athubu alaiyhim wa anath-tauwaabur-raheemThose are the people whose Tauba I accept. Those are the people who I turn back towards.  And Allah normally doesn’t say “I”.  Allah normally says ‘We’ except in cases of special Mercy He says “I” . They get special mercy from Allah just for clarifying Allah’s Book. Even the smallest efforts to say something about Islam, to see something as much as a minaret, to see as much as a poster on a bus, to see a flyer, to see a woman in hijab, to see a man in a beard, to see that much. There is a group among the disbelievers who cant even stand that much. They cant stand the sight of Allah.Yureedoona al yudfioona nurallahi bi-afwaahihim – they try to extinguish the light of Allah.  The light is any smallest manifestation of this dheen. They cant even see the smallest sign of it. You will see the face turn, you will see the change of expression.But Allah has given us His guarantee “Allah will complete His light”.  Allah will accept  no alternative except to complete His light. No matter how much disbelievers are disgusted by it, no matter how many talk shows they dedicate to it, no matter how much hate they spew out of their mouths, it will not change.  Allah will complete His light. Are you and I going to be a part of that struggle or not? Are we gonna get that great reward Allah talked about? Are we gonna be people who earn Allah’s tauba?These are efforts that are not an option that we have any more. This is the necessity of the Ummah.  And we are not doing it so people think of us we are nicer people.  No. We are doing it because we don’t want to be under the curse of Allah.  We are doing it because we have an obligation to clarify this Dheen. We are not afraid of the people. If you are doing it that “we really need to talk about Islam because they are really getting a wrong impression of Islam in the media and we need to be more likeable in the media” if that’s your intention that’s the wrong intention. That means you are afraid of the people. If we are really going to do da’wa sincerely and successfully in a way “no harm touched them” no harm will touch us – that will happen when we pursue the pleasure of Allah and the protection will come from Allah. Hasbunallhi wa ni’mal wakeel. That’s what we have to do. I sincerely pray that you and I are able to be carriers of this dheen. And look at Islam as a source of pride and not as a sense of humiliation. That we go out and talk about islam, we speak at universities, at colleges, we go and knock on our neighbours doors and ask them to come see what we are about. And not for any political motive but because this is what Allah demands from us to do. A believer’s response to Burning of the QuranNouman Ali KhanLecture 2When we come across such stupidity and idiocy what should be our reactionWe need to have clarity and consistency across our communityFirst of all these tactics are done in a very calculated and precise way to get a reaction out of Muslims and the expected reaction is that will go crazy and become overly emotional and perhaps there will be some riots like for instance in the Danish cartoon controversy there were street riots, cars were being burned down and protests were being held and shops were been torn down and they think Muslims have to show themselves as barbaric, mindless, Muslim don’t know even how to be civil…First and foremost if we react in a certain way, we are playing right into their game.  We are falling right into their trap and doing exactly what they want us to do.  And they do these things over and over just to see how we respond and we have to understand the language of response.We have to see that this is not the first time that these kinds of inciting attacks – there are two kinds of attacks, you can have a physical, military kind of attack or you can have a psychological, ideological attacks.  And these are psychological, ideological attacks.  But we need to know that Allah’s Messenger Sal. suffered both of these kinds of attacks in his own lifetime.   And the Book of Allah faced both these kinds of attacks in the life time of the Messenger sal.This is not the first time.And so when things are horrendous and outrageous things are being said about Allah’s Messenger sal. or His Book,  this is something that’s a continuation of the tradition of Quraysh.  This is not something new and Allah addressed it in His Book.If you watch the CNN clip of that weird looking pastor saying “we believe the Quran is from the devil blah blah blah” and you are gonna say how can he say that.  This is very shocking language.  And yet you find in the Quran Allah makes us understand “Wallahu bi qauli shaythanir rajeem” this is not the word of a devil because this was an accusation made already.  The accusations that Allah has talked about in the Quran, they are not coming up with anything new.  It’s the same old thing.  It’s the same old game. And Allah has given us guidance on how to respond to it.So when the Messenger was faced with the worst kind of ignorance then he was commanded Fasbir Sabrun Jameela – be patient in the most beautiful form.  Show your restraint over your emotions.  When we response we should respond intellectually.I want to address some of the comments even though they were full of ignorance at least for the younger Muslims who get fired up easily or get depressed about these thingsFirstly there’s no such as burning the Quran.  There’s no such thing.Allah revealed this book from Lawhul Mahfooz “Bal huwa Quranun majeed fee lawhin mahfooz kithaabun maknoon”.Allah talks about it as guarded and protected in the 7th Heaven.  And when Allah gave His messenger the mission to deliver the message that people wouldn’t take it seriously they would disregard the Quran What did Allah tell His Messenger sal.? this is a powerful reminder whoever wants they can make mention of it  whoever wants they can benefit from the reminder and they can and even if they don’t this is from a very high place.  This is not some journal or from a magazineSo the fact that you even get to have contact with it, that you get to hear these words is an honour for you and if you don’t want to take benefit from it, that’s your loss.  Trying to insult Allah’s Book or harm Allah’s Book is as useless as trying to spit at the sun. its gonna come back on your own face.  Its pointless.The first thing I want to share with you is what they are burning is ink and paper.  What they are burning is what is printed in a printing press. They are not burning the Quran.  The Quran is with Allah.   And then the Quran that came on the earth was revealed on the heart of Muhammedur rasoolullah“it was revealed on your  heart so you can become of those who warn”.  After that in Surah Ankabut Allah gives us a beautiful definition of the Quran bal huwa ayaatun baiyyinathun fee sudurillazeena uthul ilmThese ayat that we recite those are miraculous signs, clear miraculous signs that lie in the chests of those who have been given knowledge.  So you want to burn the Quran, you will have to burn these chests. This is where the Quran actually lies.  They cannot remove this Quran.The only people who can violate Allah’s Book and not do justice to Allah’s Book more than anyone else is the believers themselves.  If we who were given the Quran to keep in our hearts, remove it from our hearts “don’t follow the one whose heart has been made void of our remembrance” and the remembrance of Allah is the Quran.   The Quran that was supposed to be in the chest of the believers when its gone from these chests, when we don’t remember the Quran with our hearts . when we have no idea what’s being recited in Salah, when we find it boring and when we are wondering what rakah it is in taraweeh – if that’s the case with us, then we are bigger criminals – so don’t worry about anybody else, let’s worry about ourselves.  We owe something to this Book.And on top of this we very quickly look at non-Muslims and what they have done.  Very difficult for us to look in the mirror, and seriously look in the mirror.How can it be that we have Muslims all over this world and not knocking on any countries we are guilty of it ourselves that we can have decorated pieces of ayat of Quran in our homes and big framed pieces of Qul huwallahu ahad and surathul Asr and next to it is a big screen tv and you are watching movies for like 8 hours a day and next to it Allah swears by Himself that you are running out of time.  This is not disrespect of Quran?  This reminder is looking at you in the face and you couldn’t care less?  The only thing that the Quran is doing in your car is that you don’t have dual side air bags in your car so you keep a copy of Quran in your car while you are blasting filth or whatever it is in your car and you still hang the Ayatul Kursi from the rear view mirror because its gonna protect you some how?  This is Quran to you?And this is a very serious thing that we reduce the Quran to trinkets.  And am not saying don’t keep a copy of the Quran in your car and put the reminder on the rear view mirror.  I say you should do it. But when the remembrance is gone.  When the remembrance for the believer from the Quran, when it doesn’t touch their heart then there’s a very serious problem.  More serious than someone trying to burn a copy of the Quran.What they are trying to do is proving Allah’s point “they are trying to extinguish Allah’s light with their mouth and Allah is going to complete his light”.  They can bark all they want.  They can have as many barbecues as they want.  That’s not gonna change anything.  The word of Allah will be complete, the word of Allah will be supreme.  “The Speech of Allah, it is Supreme”.  He didn’t say it will be supreme or it will become supreme.  He said straight, directly “It is Supreme”.  You don’t have to elevate it, its already elevated.  Its already there, nothing can bring it down.These attacks are not new.We ourselves have to have increased dignity of Quran.  And when we look at these acts of ignorance, we need to be collected and calm and we need to understand that what they are doing is an exercise in futility.  And the attempt of it is to get the emotions of Muslims riled up.Don’t think we are disrespected by their act.  We are because what they are doing is offensive.But  the way we respond is the way we should be responding not the way they want us to respond.That’s the first point I wanted to make.The 2nd point I wanted to bring to your intention.  In the CNN interview with this pastor he said “we don’t have any problem with the Muslims, but the Sharia Law is from the devil”.  And this is something that is being repeated over and over again how barbaric sharia law is in academic circles like Harvard and Columbia University forums are being held how sharia law does not jive with modern civilization. And they have had seminars in the last few years in a row about how the principles of Islamic law that deal with women and inheritance and idda these are controversial issues and we have to find a way to help the Muslims to re-interpret them, in a way that is more politically correct etc etc. and they have had several forums on this issue at higher academic circles.How do we respond to that?How do we respond to the pastor?  For yourselfAny law of Islam that is mentioned in the Quran that they call from the devil is already mentioned in the Bible.  Allah already revealed it.  What Allah revealed to us was a confirmation already revealed to them.And the things that they call most controversial, they call jihad controversial read about ‘smiting nations’ in the Bible.  Which Book has more violence in it and there is no comparison the Bible has far more violence according to their standard.  We didn’t say anything.The bible talks about not sparing a man woman or child and burning down trees and breaking every house.  There are passages like that in the Bible. And they conveniently say “we don’t follow our book” what a thing to be taking pride in ? We don’t follow our book.	But they want us to be that way.The other thing that was made a big controversy is that “o you muslims have this law of Riddah”.  i.e. when someone leaves Islam.  And they don’t understand the fiqh of it or its interpretation.  But they say if somebody leaves Islam you are going to kill him.  So really?  You don’t know about that.  What about when Musa Al. went up to the mountain and the people started worshipping the calf and when he came back what did Allah reveal?  Kill your own people the ones who have left Islam.  This is in the Quran.  It is in the Torah.The ones who have left Islam and worshipped the calf their punishment is that they should be executed.  This is our sharia law.  This is the shariah of musa al. and it’s a continuation.  Its not something new.  This is something in your own Book.   You don’t look at that as controversial.  Zaalikum khairullakum indha baari’ikum.  Allah told them that is better for you (for your nation) as far as your lord is concerned. And He will accept your tauba if you do so.  He will punish each tribe of the 12 tribes of Israel and each tribe we are told in Surathul Baqara was commanded to execute those who had left Islam.  And we are not saying that we do that with our people actually because there is more involved to this law actually.But to think that a pastor who teaches the bible can get up on a podium and talk about how these laws are from the devil and yet they are found in his own book  that’s fascinating to me.  That’s incredible to me.And the scariest thing is when Muslims are listening to these things and especially the level of ignorance Muslims have reached and I say this over and over again and I don’t get tired of it.  The biggest weapon the enemies of Islam have is not the media, it is more powerful than that and it is the ignorance of the Muslims. That’s the weapon they have.  They have no other weapon.If the Muslim is equipped with knowledge if the Muslim is equipped with a proper education of his own Book then the Muslim has nothing to fear.When I travel a lot I listen to a lot of Christian talk radio – what are they saying about Muslims.  I was travelling to Oklahoma and there was this pastor on the radio and he was saying I challenge any Muslim to call us on this station and we have our Quran expert here and he’s gonna tell you what’s what and he’s gonna show you how there are contradictions in the Quran.I call up like 10 times and they keep hanging up on me. They have these fake callers. They call up and say I used to be Muslim but now I see the light hallelujah and they will celebrate that another one has seen the light. But its all staged and you can tell that its clearly staged because the one who is supposedly Muslim says weirdo things and doesn’t even say Assalamu Alaiykum properly.  So you know its all drama and staged. It’s a comedy.  But the scary thing is that there is a Muslim out there listening to this who doesn’t have knowledge. And he is listening to that and its getting into his head.  And he’s getting impressed with it.  And he’s getting twisted with it.And its not just Christian radio.  Our youth are going to college and part of your requirement is to take a couple of course in philosophy and nowadays a lot of the colleges are offering Islamic history  of course being taught by non-Muslims with very non-Muslim agendas.I had the opportunity to meet with a head of History Dept in Valencia College Florida and he got fired because he refused to teach the book Classic Civilizations because they were trying to push this idea that Muslims and Christians and western worlds were supposed to clash and fight. And he said “I don’t believe in this idea, there are other texts that we can teach”. Got fired.So what they pretend to be open minded academics and we look at things analytical but its all hog wash and our youth are going to university.  Am not saying they shouldn’t go to university.  But they are getting exposed to this and they don’t have a response from the Muslim side.They take 2 philosophy classes and they get messed up in their heads.  They think they know philosophy – they don’t.  they don’t get their answers to their questions from their families or from their local masjid.When a nation is not aware it cannot survive.Our Ummah we are not defined by our knowledge.  We are not a knowledgeable community.  The masajid have now to serve the role of not just being the places of worship but now the centres of learning which is why its so important that we further the institutions that we already have and create more institutions that can serve more needs.We have to be equipped, we have to be ready.  The bani Israel were told to believe in what Allah send down We have to take this seriouslyThe religion for everyone else is just a culture. Something their parents handed down.  For us this is a mission.  Our religion, our dheen is a missioin.  The mission of your life is not to get a promotion.  The mission of your life is not to open a 2nd store or buy that car that you were waiting for. Those are not missions.  Those are just side things. Your mission is this this dheen.  Your life your death My prayer, life my sacrifice and my death are for AllahWhen we understand that, that is my mission then we will begin to do justice to this book.Don’t be distracted by stupid things in the media.  You should be reciting and understanding Allah’s Book.Be productive engage in the masjid, listen to the halaqa. Learn and ask questions.  Learn more about your religion.You have to become engaged.
